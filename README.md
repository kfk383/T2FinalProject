# Spring Term Final Project
Team Name: Good Lok

Our final project will be a restaurant game, coded using Processing. The game will have two modes: a "cooking" mode and a "serving" mode, in which the player acts as the chef or the waiter in the restaurant. Throughout the game, the character will unlock various recipes and/or difficulties.
